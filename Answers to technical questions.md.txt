### 1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?  

I spent around **4–5 hours** on the coding test.  
If I had more time, I would have focused on:  
- Adding **unit and feature tests** to ensure reliability.  
- Improving **error handling** and adding meaningful error messages.  
- Enhancing **security measures** such as input validation and sanitization.  
- Writing more **modular and reusable code** to improve maintainability.  
- Adding **documentation** and inline comments for clarity.  
- Optimizing database queries to ensure better performance.

### 2. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?  

To track down a performance issue in production, I would:  
1. **Identify symptoms** – monitor logs, server metrics, and user reports.  
2. **Check application logs** for slow queries, exceptions, or memory leaks.  
3. Use **profiling tools** (like Laravel Telescope, Xdebug, or New Relic) to identify bottlenecks.  
4. Inspect **database queries** – check for missing indexes, N+1 queries, or unoptimized joins.  
5. Monitor **server performance** (CPU, memory, I/O usage) and optimize accordingly.  
6. Use **caching mechanisms** (query caching, Redis, or application-level caching).  
7. Gradually deploy fixes and validate improvements.  

Yes, I have had to do this. In one instance, a production app faced **slow page load times due to unoptimized queries**. I resolved it by analyzing queries with `EXPLAIN`, adding proper indexes, and using eager loading to eliminate N+1 problems.
